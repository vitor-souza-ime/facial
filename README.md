😊 Emotion Detection with DeepFace

Welcome to the Emotion Detection with DeepFace project! This Python script leverages the DeepFace library to analyze facial emotions in images, downloading sample images for various emotions, detecting the dominant emotion, and displaying the results with Matplotlib.
✨ Features

📥 Downloads images for seven emotions: disgust, happy, sad, angry, surprise, neutral, and fear.

🧠 Analyzes facial emotions using the DeepFace library.
🖼️ Displays images with expected vs. detected emotions.
💾 Saves downloaded images in an emotion_images directory.

🛠️ Requirements

To run this project, you'll need:

Python 3.x
Required libraries:pip install opencv-python requests deepface matplotlib



🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repository:git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>


Run the script:python emotion_detection.py


What happens:

Creates an emotion_images directory for storing images.
Downloads images for each emotion from predefined URLs.
Analyzes each image to detect the dominant emotion.
Displays the images with titles showing expected and detected emotions.



📂 Project Structure


emotion_detection.py: Core script for downloading, analyzing, and displaying results.
emotion_images/: Directory for downloaded images.
README.md: This file, providing project documentation.

⚠️ Notes


Ensure a stable internet connection for downloading images.
DeepFace requires detectable faces in images. If a face isn't detected, an error will be logged.
The script uses enforce_detection=True to prioritize face detection, which may cause exceptions for images without clear faces.
